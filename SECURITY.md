## Security Considerations

### Docker Socket Access

Patchy requires access to the Docker socket to function. Please be aware of the following:

1. **Socket Permissions**: 
   - Only grant socket access if you trust this application
   - Consider using reduced-privilege alternatives when possible

2. **Container Security**:
   - Run Patchy with minimal required permissions
   - Use read-only access where possible
   - Keep the container updated for security patches

### Best Practices

1. **Stay Updated**:
   - Use the latest version of Patchy
   - Enable automatic updates when possible
   - Watch our release announcements for security updates

2. **Configuration**:
   - Use secure configuration settings
   - Limit network exposure
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
